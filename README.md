# Emotion-Analysis
This repository focuses on building a multi-class emotion classification model using the GoEmotion dataset, which contains various emotion labels. The project includes data preprocessing, text cleaning, and feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization. The model is trained with multiple classifiers such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, and performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.

The goal of this project is to classify emotions expressed in text data into predefined categories. It demonstrates the process of handling text data for machine learning tasks, including model selection, training, and evaluation. The repository provides the necessary code for understanding emotion detection and classification workflows.
